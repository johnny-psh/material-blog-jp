# material-blog-jp (Jekyll Theme)
Material-blog-jp is a blog build following material design principles. This theme is built using material design lite web framework. 

This theme consists of four web pages, index, about, search and 404. Index will display all the blog posts, starting from the latest. Search will display a text field input and two of the latest blog posting. About will contain a description about the blog. 404 will display when someone tried to access a resource that can not be found. This theme is optimized for mobile phones, iPads, etc

Due to some of the limitations, please have at least two posts to push the footers to the bottom of the page, same goes for the "about" section.

## Usage

There are four default pages:
- index.md 
- about.md
- search.md
- 404.md

Each page has a different title. Edit the title in the Front Matter.

The blog title needs to be edited in _config.yml 
Fill in the options in _config.yml accordingly. This will be used for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

To create a new post, follow the naming format in the two example post. Since this blog uses images for each post, select an image and put it inside the assets folder. Follow the naming convention as the two sample image.

## Technical
Web Framework: Material Design Lite

Static Site Generator: Jekyll

Javascript Libraries: jQuery


For search, I am using "simple jekyll search" by Chistian Fei

Material design lite header I am using is not mobile optimized and requires some additional CSS.

jQuery is used for the arrow button to scroll the screen back to the top.
